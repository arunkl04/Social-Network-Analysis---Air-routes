# Social Network Analysis Air routes

- This project is aimed at resolving and providing suggestion to users to select shortest path for the airline route without any connection and would provide suggestion to find the best cheapest price for the route even if it has multiple layover
- The main thing a traveler considers when travelling from Point A to Point B through airplane is time involved in traveling.
- Some travelers doesn’t care about time and layovers involved and can travel from Point A to Point B which any layovers involved provided that it is cheaper
- Some travelers doesn’t care about cost involved and prefer to reach destination with minimum layover, predominantly business travelers
- To cater the users who care about time we are developing and analyzing a network model to suggest them with shortest time.
